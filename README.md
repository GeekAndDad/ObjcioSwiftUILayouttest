# ObjcioSwiftUILayouttest
Tried out a simpler approach to the puzzler @objcio used for a SwiftUI video.  
Doesn't quite meet the requirements though:  
The plane is supposed to move when the first lable runs out of room and needs
to be elided and this doesn't do that.

Looks pretty good otherwise and avoids the shadow view hierarchy just for measuring
which is what bothered me enough to take a stab at this.

Have some other ideas I may try out, time permitting.
